This is a website that displays a fractal that reacts to the music you upload. The fractal pattern changes its complex and real comonenets based on the fluxtuations in the frequency of the music you upload to the website (click the purplwe uplaod button). The you can select what parts of the music you want the fractal to react to (the green bars at the bottom) and watch it go. There's also a black box above the play button, clicking that allows you to select how the fractal is formed. Basically this particular fractal is a Julia set, and you can change how it's generated by changing its starting point which can be found on the mandlebrot set. That's whats in the box where you can click to select the area you want.

The project is just HTML, CSS, and JS, and uses web audio to uplaod the sound and seperate the frequencies. I wanted to do this because I've been learning about fractals recently and when I had the chance to make a sound based website I wanted to try and incorporate that part. I also listen to music with a ton of bass (I was listening to future's mixtap run while making it) so that's what got me to program it to react in the way it does.
